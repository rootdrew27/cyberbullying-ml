Background

Semi-Supervised Learning
- Through the use of an query algorithm and labeled data, a larger dataset is composed. This larger dataset is believed to be more adaquate for training a model.

- This method makes the assumption that their algorithm will accuractely label data the majority of the time.

- Many of the methods used in semi-supervised learning rely on the consistency assumption, the low-density separation assumption, and the manifold assumption.

Semi-Supervised Learning methods are domain specific!
